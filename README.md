## Introduction  

J.A.T.E (Just Another Text Editor) is a single page text editor application that runs in the browser and meets Progressive Web Application (PWA) criteria, that is - works offline, may be installed, and implements an "app shell" architecture. Additionally, it incorporates redundant data assurance features including browser local storage and IndexedDB.
